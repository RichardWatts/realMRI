Animated Pulse Sequences
========================

Animations showing the traversal of k-space during different pulse sequences can be found at the following links. As you watch them, remember the road rules for k-space: We start in the middle of k-space, and the strength and direction of the magnetic field gradient determines our velocity in k-space at each point in time.
